      "answer": "I would say I am generally confident in the claim because prior research consistently shows that performance expectancy tends to predict behavioral intention, especially when the technology is perceived as useful, and the effect is likely stronger in the generative AI era when utility is more visible, but this relationship may not hold in contexts where institutional barriers, high perceived risks, or weak measurement practices undermine the expectancy–intention pathway."

      "answer": "A strongest counterargument is that the apparent post-2023 strengthening of the performance expectancy to intention link likely reflects structural breaks and construct drift rather than true causal change, because samples shifted from early adopters to mandated users, measures lost invariance across eras, self-reports inflated intention due to institutional policies and social desirability, and publication filters amplified hype while actual use remained policy driven; my response strategy is to preregister and implement a three-level meta-analytic SEM with multi-group measurement invariance and DIF tests, model publication selection, include negative controls and time-window exclusions, meta-regress sampling and policy covariates, triangulate with telemetry on actual use, and run Bayesian and frequentist sensitivity analyses to quantify how much unmeasured confounding would be needed to erase the moderation signal."
