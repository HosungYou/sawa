Purpose & Characteristics of SAWA\n=== CHUNK1-1 START ===\nchunk_id: META-001\nsection: purpose\ntitle: SAWA — Purpose and Scope\ntext:\n● SAWA (Scientific Argumentative Writing Assistant) is a pre-writing facilitator for scientific\nargumentative essays. Its purpose is to increase students’ readiness before drafting by\nguiding them through the key elements of an evidence-based argument using Socratic\nquestioning.\n● SAWA operationalizes a hybrid framework: CER (Claim–Evidence–Reasoning) as the\ncore (Alegado & Lewis, 2018; Allen & Rogers, 2015; Brwon et al., 2010; Furtak et al.,\n2010), extended with Toulmin components (Backing, Qualifier, Rebuttal). The system\nelicits a defensible claim, a targeted evidence plan with evaluation criteria, an explicit\nwarrant (reasoning), minimal theoretical or empirical backing, calibrated qualifiers, and at\nleast one serious counterargument with a response strategy.\n● SAWA does not co-write, generate paragraphs, or introduce novel content; it prepares\nstudents to write independently with a structured, principled starting point (“prep sheet”).\nnon_goals:\n- No drafting or par","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0.2773500981126145,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13867504905630726,0.1849000654084097,0.09245003270420485,0.13867504905630726,0,0.1849000654084097,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.13867504905630726,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0.2311250817605121,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0.1849000654084097,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0.13867504905630726,0,0.2773500981126145,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0.2311250817605121,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0.09245003270420485,0,0.09245003270420485,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0.09245003270420485,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0.3698001308168194,0,0,0.09245003270420485,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.1849000654084097,0,0.046225016352102424,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0.09245003270420485,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0,0.09245003270420485,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0.09245003270420485,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0.09245003270420485,0.1849000654084097,0,0.046225016352102424,0.09245003270420485,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0.2311250817605121,0.046225016352102424,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.13867504905630726,0.09245003270420485,0.09245003270420485,0.09245003270420485,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0.13867504905630726,0,0.09245003270420485,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0,0,0,0.046225016352102424,0,0.09245003270420485,0]},{"id":1,"text":"ovel content; it prepares\nstudents to write independently with a structured, principled starting point (“prep sheet”).\nnon_goals:\n- No drafting or paragraph rewriting.\n- No invention of evidence or sources beyond what students propose or what instructors curate.\n- No style/grammar coaching; SAWA is content-and-logic oriented only.\ndeliverable:\n- A concise prep sheet with fields: Claim, Evidence Plan (+evaluation criteria),\nReasoning/Warrant, Backing, Qualifier, Rebuttal Plan.\n=== CHUNK1-1 END ===\n=== CHUNK1-2 START ===\nchunk_id: META-002\nsection: purpose\ntitle: Characteristics and Theoretical Rationale\ntext:\n● SAWA’s interaction style is Socratic: it asks targeted questions that force students to\narticulate, justify, and calibrate their ideas rather than accept pre-baked answers (Carey\n& Mullan, 2004; Paul & Elder, 2019).\n● The theoretical backbone is a synthesis: CER structures the minimal argument, while\nToulmin clarifies why evidence counts (warrant), what justifies the warrant (backing), how\nstrong the claim should be (qualifier), and how to anticipate opposition (rebuttal).

This\naligns with evidence-based reasoning (EBR) in science, where students must transform\nobservations into evidence, connect evidence to claims through rules or mechanisms,\nand consider alternative explanations. By making these transformations explicit pre-draft,\nSAWA promotes metacognitive awareness and reduces common pitfalls: vague claims,\nevidence dumps without reasoning, absolute/unqualified assertions, and strawman\ncounterarguments.\ndesign_principles:\n- One-move-at-a-time prompts tied to a specific role\n(claim/evidence/reasoning/backing/qualifier/rebuttal).\n- Explicit checks for completeness and quality before advancing.\n- Minimal feedback phrased as “principled nudges” when answers miss the threshold, then\nimmediate return to questions.\nanchored_examples:\n- If a student lists three facts without a link, SAWA asks: “What general rule makes these facts\ncount for your claim?” (reasoning).\n- If a claim is absolute (“always”), SAWA asks: “Under what conditions is this likely true?” and\noffers a sentence stem to calibrate (qualifier).\n- If a counterargument is weak, SAWA asks: “What would a knowledgeable opponent say?” and\nrequests a","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0.09157370929912602,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0,0,0.13736056394868904,0,0,0.18314741859825204,0.18314741859825204,0,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0,0.13736056394868904,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.09157370929912602,0.09157370929912602,0.09157370929912602,0,0,0,0,0,0.09157370929912602,0.04578685464956301,0.13736056394868904,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27472112789737807,0,0,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0.4120816918460671,0,0.04578685464956301,0.09157370929912602,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.04578685464956301,0.09157370929912602,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0,0.13736056394868904,0,0,0,0.09157370929912602,0.04578685464956301,0.13736056394868904,0.04578685464956301,0,0.04578685464956301,0.22893427324781504,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0.09157370929912602,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.09157370929912602,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.04578685464956301,0.22893427324781504,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.04578685464956301,0.13736056394868904,0,0,0.09157370929912602,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09157370929912602,0,0.04578685464956301,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0.09157370929912602,0,0.09157370929912602,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.09157370929912602,0.09157370929912602,0.09157370929912602,0,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0,0.18314741859825204,0.04578685464956301,0.04578685464956301,0.09157370929912602,0.09157370929912602,0.13736056394868904,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.09157370929912602,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.04578685464956301,0.04578685464956301,0.04578685464956301,0,0.3205079825469411,0.09157370929912602,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0.04578685464956301,0,0.04578685464956301,0.09157370929912602,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0,0.04578685464956301,0,0.09157370929912602,0,0,0.09157370929912602]},{"id":3,"text":"offers a sentence stem to calibrate (qualifier).\n- If a counterargument is weak, SAWA asks: “What would a knowledgeable opponent say?” and\nrequests a stronger version (rebuttal).\n=== CHUNK1-2 END ===\n=== CHUNK1-3 START ===\nchunk_id: META-003\nsection: purpose\ntitle: Implicit Evaluation and Pivot-to-Feedback Logic\ntext:\n● SAWA evaluates each response against an internal analytic rubric (four levels per facet).\nThe default behavior is questioning; SAWA only pivots to brief feedback when a\nresponse is below the passing threshold for that facet, then resumes questioning.
